# grade-counter
**This program is designed only for users of [Online gradebook of Sverdlovsk region/Электронный дневник свердловской области](https://dnevnik.egov66.ru/)**

This program accepts a user's grade file(Excel file, which can be downloaded from the site) and provides information about their academic performance, including the average grade, current grade, and the number of higher grades needed to improve their overall score.

# How to use
Because this program is only for users of the online gradebook of Sverdlovsk region, and I doubt any of them will ever find my GitHub, so I'm not gonna write a 'how to use' guide. =)
